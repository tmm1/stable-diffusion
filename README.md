This is a fork of [CompVis/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion), the open
source text-to-image generator. It provides a streamlined process with various new features and
options to aid the image generation process. It runs on Windows, Mac and Linux machines, and runs on
GPU cards with as little as 4 GB or RAM.

_Note: This fork is rapidly evolving. Please use the
[Issues](https://github.com/lstein/stable-diffusion/issues) tab to report bugs and make feature
requests. Be sure to use the provided templates. They will help aid diagnose issues faster._

### Installation

This fork is supported across multiple platforms. You can find individual installation instructions
below.

- #### [Linux](docs/installation/INSTALL_LINUX.md)

- #### [Windows](docs/installation/INSTALL_WINDOWS.md)

- #### [Macintosh](docs/installation/INSTALL_MAC.md)

### Hardware Requirements

#### System

You wil need one of the following:

- An NVIDIA-based graphics card with 4 GB or more VRAM memory.
- An Apple computer with an M1 chip.

#### Memory

- At least 12 GB Main Memory RAM.

#### Disk

- At least 6 GB of free disk space for the machine learning model, Python, and all its dependencies.

> Note
>
> If you have an Nvidia 10xx series card (e.g. the 1080ti), please run the dream script in
> full-precision mode as shown below.

Similarly, specify full-precision mode on Apple M1 hardware.

To run in full-precision mode, start `dream.py` with the `--full_precision` flag:

```bash
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ python scripts/dream.py --full_precision
```

### Troubleshooting

Please check out our **[Q&A](docs/help/TROUBLESHOOT.md)** to get solutions for common installation
problems and other issues.

### Contributing

Anyone who wishes to contribute to this project, whether documentation, features, bug fixes, code
cleanup, testing, or code reviews, is very much encouraged to do so. If you are unfamiliar with how
to contribute to GitHub projects, here is a
[Getting Started Guide](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github).

A full set of contribution guidelines, along with templates, are in progress, but for now the most
important thing is to **make your pull request against the "development" branch**, and not against
"main". This will help keep public breakage to a minimum and will allow you to propose more radical
changes.
